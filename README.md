The client is Artemis Financial. They needed assistance with software security. Specifically, they needed help with checking for vulnerabilities and addressing them.

After identifying vulnerabilities in their software, I was able to patch them. I also added self-signing certificates and added encryption to their communications. Secure coding is crucial because it adds protection to sensitive data and communication. It attempts to prevent unauthorized access to their data. This adds to the company's value by protecting their reputation and maintaining the trust of the clients.

The part of the assesment that was most challenging was making sure that the version of java used was updated, and having that reflected in the pom file. Many times, the version number listed in the pom file was no longer supported.

To increase the layers of security, I added encryption to the sensitive data, enabled HTTPS protocol, and added self-signed certificates. In my future endeavours, I would use penetration testing to asses any vulnerabilities and other various scanning tools to help choose the appropriate techniques for mitigation.

To ensure functionality, I uses several types of testing. I used static code analysis tools to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I would use the code analysis before and after refactoring to verify.

For future assignments, I found that using penetration testing, vulnerability scanning tools, and best secure coding practices to be most helpful.

I would show future employers examples of the secure code I wrote for this exercise. They could also view the vulnerability assesment reports I created, as well as what I did to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
